The **Java OOP** course will teach the principles of object-oriented object-oriented programming (OOP), working with classes and subclasses, using object-oriented modeling, and building class hierarchies.
Basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism are studied. The course will go into the most commonly used design patterns.
The course will pay attention to component testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD), the use of reflection. The development environment that will be used is IntelliJ Idea 2020.
